Hi, I'm @kleedaisuki.

So, what's this self-introduction used for? It seems that the Bio below the profile photo has played a similar function? Anyway, it's never too much to let others know about me. So, I finished this README.md.

**About me**:

- major in computer science.
- not good at English and I'm trying to improve.
- prefer Microsoft products for work, while Google's for daily life.
- don't know how to set font in Markdown.
- living in Tokyo.
- not lolicon.
